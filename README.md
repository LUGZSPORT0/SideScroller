# Space SideScroller

Utilizing the book *Game Programming in C++* by Sanjay Madhav. this is Project 2. I will be incorporating the excercises from the end of the chapter into the game and where applicable adding in my own artisic style. 

##Book Features:
Ability to add multiple "Actors" on the screen.

##Personal Features:
The assets provided had a "laser" sprite. I decided to see if I was able to implement it into the game. It worked! I then added code to make the enemy disappear. My next goal is to create an explosion sprite to give better effects and add it to the game.

This project uses SDL, Simple Directmedia Layer. Get it here, [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases "Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) is a framework for creating cross-platform games and applications.")
