# SideScroller

Utilizing the book, "Game Programming in C++" this is Project 2. I will be incorporating the excercises from the end of the chapter into the game and where applicable adding in my own artisic style. Everything else is either typed out from the books Github or pasted i.e., the Math.h file.

This project uses SDL, Simple Directmedia Layer. Get it here, [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases "Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) is a framework for creating cross-platform games and applications.")
