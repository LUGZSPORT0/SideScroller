# SideScroller

Utilizing the book *Game Programming in C++* by Sanjay Madhav. this is Project 2. I will be incorporating the excercises from the end of the chapter into the game and where applicable adding in my own artisic style. Everything else is either typed out from the books Github [gameprogcpp](https://github.com/gameprogcpp/code) or pasted i.e., the Math.h file.
